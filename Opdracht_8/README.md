- Calculate the 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.99% confidence interval for at least 2 columns with numerical data in the dataset that you chose in portofolio assignment 4. Do you see the impact the confidence has on the interval?
- Now calculate the 95% confidence interval again but use only the first 10% of your rows. Compare this interval to the previous 95% confidence interval you calculated. Do you see the impact of having less data?
